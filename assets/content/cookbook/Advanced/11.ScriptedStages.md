# Scripted Stages

This chapter will walk you through the process of adding a script to a Stage, and giving examples of the kind of custom behavior which can be implemented with this functionality.

Start by creating a scripted class file with the `.hxc` extension (in the `mods/mymod/scripts/stages` if you want to keep things organized)

```haxe
// Remember to import each class you want to reference in your script!
import funkin.play.stage.Stage;

// Choose a name for your scripted class that will be unique, and make sure to specifically extend the Stage class.
// This class's functions will override the default behavior for the stage.
class WhittyAlleywayStage extends Stage {
    public function new() {
        // The constructor gets called once, when the game loads.
        // The constructor takes one parameter, which is the stage ID for the stage you are applying the script to.
		super('alleyway');
	}

    // Add override functions here!
}
```

You can then add override functions to perform custom behavior.

## Custom Behavior when adding a Character

Considering characters get applied later in the initialization process, you would need to override the function `addCharacter` if you want to perform custom behavior involving characters. With this, you can set a shader to the added character immidiately after they're added. An example of this is found in the script for the stage Mall (Erect)[^mall]
```haxe
// ...

// Line 35
override function addCharacter(character:BaseCharacter, charType:CharacterType):Void
{
    // Apply the shader automatically to each character as it gets added.
    super.addCharacter(character, charType);
    trace('Applied stage shader to ' + character.characterName);
    character.shader = colorShader;
}

// ...
```

## Custom Behavior when building a Stage

By overriding the function `buildStage`, you can set up custom behavior to activate when stage props get initialized. By doing this, you can immidiately apply a shader effect to props or instantly add scripted props to the stage. This is done in the stage script for Tankman Battlefield[^tank]
```haxe 
// ...

// Line 21
override function buildStage()
{
    super.buildStage();

    clouds = new FlxTiledSprite(Paths.image('tankClouds'), 3200, 235, true, false);
    clouds.setPosition(-1100, 20);
    clouds.scrollFactor.set(0.25, 0.25);
    clouds.zIndex = 12;

    clouds.velocity.x = 8;

    PlayState.instance.currentStage.add(clouds);
    PlayState.instance.currentStage.refresh(); // Apply z-index.

    tankAngle = FlxG.random.int(-90, 45);
    tankSpeed = FlxG.random.float(5, 7);
}

// ...
```
