# Text Files

While not used much by Friday Night Funkin' (in exception to `introText.txt`), the ability to read and save to text files may be useful for some mods. 

## Reading a .txt file

To read a text file, you will need to import the following import:
-`funkin.Paths` 
(this is to make sure the game reads the text file from your mod and not accidently from the base games `assets` folder.

The text file must exist to be read and have content in it to be read by the game. The text file will be read from the `data` folder.

Below is an example of how to read a text file.

```Hscript
import funkin.modding.module.Module;
import funkin.Paths; //required module to make sure it reads the text file from the mods folder and not the assets folder

class tutorial extends Module {
    var data:String = '';//this variable will contain the text when we read the text file
    public function new() {
        super("tutorial");
    }
    
    override public function onCreate():Void {//this will be called once upon the game starting
        super.onCreate();
        data = Assets.getText(Paths.txt("Player")); //txt file, ALWAYS in "data" folder 
        trace('text contents are ' + data); //prints contents of text file in the console
    }
}
```

## Saving to a .txt file

Unlike reading a text file, some more things will need to be imported to correctly save a text file. More specifically you will need to import the following:
-`funkin.util.FileUtilSandboxed`
-`funkin.util.FileWriteMode` 
these are needed to save text files. Like reading a text file, the text files MUST be in your `data` folder in your mod, and must already exist before 
attempting to save to it (the game will NOT create a text file if it does not already exist).

Below is an example of how to save a text file.

```Hscript
import funkin.modding.module.Module;
import funkin.Paths; //required module to make sure it reads the text file from the mods folder and not the assets folder
import funkin.util.FileUtilSandboxed; //required module to save text files
import funkin.util.FileWriteMode; //for write modes
class tutorial extends Module {
    public function new() {
        super("tutorial");
    }
    
    override public function onCreate():Void {//this will be called upon the game starting
        super.onCreate();
        FileUtilSandboxed.writeStringToPath(Assets.getPath(Paths.txt("Player")), 'extra large potato', FileWriteMode.Force); 
        //above will save to our mod's data folder to the text file named "Player.txt" and will write "extra large potato" in said text file and forces it to be saved
    }
}
```
