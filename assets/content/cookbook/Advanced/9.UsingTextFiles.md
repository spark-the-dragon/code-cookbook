# Text Files

While not used much by Friday Night Funkin' (in exception to `introText.txt`), the ability to read and save to text files may be useful for some mods. 

## Reading a .txt file

To read a text file, you will need to import the following import:
"-`funkin.Paths`"
this is to make sure the game reads the text file from your mod and not accidently from the base games `assets` folder.

The text file must exist to be read and have content in it to be read by the game. The text file will be read from the `data` folder.

Below is an example of how to read a text file.

```haxe
import funkin.modding.module.Module;
import funkin.Paths; //Required module to make sure it reads the text file from the mods folder and not the assets folder.

class Tutorial extends Module {
    var data:String = ''; //This variable will contain the text when we read the text file.
    public function new() 
    {
        super("Tutorial");
    }
    
    override public function onCreate():Void //This will be called once upon the game starting.
    { 
        super.onCreate();
        data = Assets.getText(Paths.txt("Player")); //Txt file, ALWAYS in "data" folder.
        trace('text contents are ' + data); //Prints contents of text file in the console.
    }
}
```

## Saving to a .txt file

Unlike reading a text file, some more things will need to be imported to correctly save a text file. More specifically you will need to import the following:
"-`funkin.util.FileUtilSandboxed`"
"-`funkin.util.FileWriteMode`"

These are needed to save text files. Like reading a text file, the text files MUST be in your `data` folder in your mod, and must already exist before attempting to save to it (the game will NOT create a text file if it does not already exist).

Below is an example of how to save a text file.

```haxe
import funkin.modding.module.Module;
import funkin.Paths; //Required module to make sure it reads the text file from the mods folder and not the assets folder.
import funkin.util.FileUtil; //Required module to save text files
class Tutorial extends Module {
    public function new() 
    {
        super("Tutorial");
    }
    
    override public function onCreate():Void //this will be called upon the game starting
    {
        super.onCreate();
        FileUtil.writeStringToPath(Assets.getPath(Paths.txt("Player")), 'extra large potato'); 
        //Above will save to our mod's data folder to the text file named "Player.txt" and will write "extra large potato" in said text file
    }
}
```
